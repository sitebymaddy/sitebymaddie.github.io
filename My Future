     <h2>My Future</h2> 
     <p>I want to be a Medical Assistant or a District Manager for a surf/skate company</p> 
     
        <h2>Why do I want to do This??</h2> 
        <p>I want to have a nice paying job and also want to work in a Dr. office. I like to help people out and i think being a Medical Assistant would be a nice job. On the other hand being in retail would be fun as well because it isn't too serious and you still get paid pretty good. You can also get a good amount of days off.</p>

        <h2>What kind of Life I want to live?</h2> 
       <p>I want to get married around 25 or 27 years old because i still want to have fun before that time and not be tied down to a family. But once that time comes I want 4 kids. I want to live in Hungigton Beach in a 2 story house. </p>
